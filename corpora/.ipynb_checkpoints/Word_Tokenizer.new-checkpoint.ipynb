Tensorflow is a deep learning framwork developed by Google, and Keras is a frontend library built on top of Tensorflow (or Theano, CNTK) to provide an easier way to use standard layers and networks.\n",

    "- One-Dimentional Convolution Neural Network (1D-CNN)\n",
    "- Recurrent Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)\n",

    "and one more model of your choice to achieve the highest score possible.\n",

    "We provide the code for data cleaning and some starter code for keras in this notebook but feel free to modify those parts to suit your needs. You can also complete this exercise using only Tensorflow (without using Keras). Feel free to use additional libraries (e.g. scikit-learn) as long as you have a model for each type mentioned above.\n",

These vectors are trained along with other layers by back propagation. The reason for using embedding layer is that we hope high dimentional vectors of a characters contain relation between each character.\n",
